#### Be the light and life of the party with PocketRave!  

This project is based on the **advanced** seed project for Angular 2 apps based on [Minko Gechev's](https://github.com/mgechev) [angular2-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) that expands on all of its great features to include core support for NativeScript moble apps as well as web apps. There is also support for Electron apps for the Desktop, and much more. The Advanced Seed was built by [Nathan Walker](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced), and we owe him much gratitude for his constant support of it, and of this project. Thank you Nathan!

The concept behind PocketRave is that you can draw images on the mobile app and pair them with music selected from SoundCloud, and then play your creations on a big screen (on the web) in a Kaleidoscope format. Check out some premade PocketRaves at
[PocketRave.me](http://PocketRave.me).
